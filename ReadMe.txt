SD2 A6: SimpleMiner Gold

Known Issues:
	I am currently using step-and-sample raycasting rather than Amenatides-Woo.
	I am not currently saving the player's velocity.
	The player will slightly pop up blocks when jumping up against them slightly, though it is typically when the player would make it onto the block anyway.
	Footsteps are only based on the block directly below the player's center.

How to Use:
	Run by opening SimpleMiner.exe.

	Keyboard Controls:
		Holding 'W'moves the player forward in the direction it is facing.
		Holding 'A' and 'D' moves the player left and right respectively.
		Holding 'Space' moves the player up in FLYING mode, pressing it makes the player jump in WALKING mode.
		Holding 'CTRL' moves the player down in FLYING mode, it does nothing in WALKING mode.
		Holding 'Shift' makes the player move 8 times faster.
		Pressing 'F5' changes the camera mode between first-person, from-behind, fixed-angle, and no-clip.
		Pressing 'F6' changes the player's movement mode between walking and flying.
		Pressing 'F7' moves the player's body to the camera in no-clip mode, it does nothing otherwise.
		Pressing the number keys (1-0) selects the corresponding block.

		Pressing 'E' when in walking mode attaches the player to the targetted block with a grappling hook.
		Pressing 'Space' when attached to a block will make the player jump and detach them from the block.

	Mouse Controls:
		Moving the mouse changes the camera's orientation.
		Pressing 'Left Mouse Button' destroys the targetted block.
		Pressing 'Right Mouse Button' places the selected block at the targetted block face.
		Scrolling with the mousewheel changes the selected block.

	Pressing 'Escape' closes the game.

Bonus Features:
	Trees
	Biomes
	Grappling Hook/Swinging - press 'E' to use
